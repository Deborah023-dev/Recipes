# Recipes
 
 
 A digital archive of recipes I've followed or created, and what I've learned from making that particular dish. 

 This poject features links to where recipes have been sources, photos of the actual finished product, and reviews from myself and my loved ones. 

 This project was created using HTML and CSS. I chose these tools because they were beginner friendly, easy to build upon, and have countless resources available. In the future, I would like to implement JavaScript to dynamically control the multimedia portion of this site. 

 I greatly appreciate contributions in the following areas:
 - Grammar fixes
 -Proofreading or editing
 -Refining the HTML or CSS markup either for aesthetic or efficiency purposes
